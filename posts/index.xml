      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to create my own website, so during winter break, I decided to do just that. I could have gone about it the smart way by hosting on a cloud provider like AWS or the like.
I decide to do it the hard way and run my own webserver.
Do I regret it? A bit, since it cost more than I would like (although hopefully in the long term, I recoup that investment since the only persistent cost is the domain name and minor electricity usage).</description>
