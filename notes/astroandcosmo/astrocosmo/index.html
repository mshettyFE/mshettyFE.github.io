Make sure weakest link knows everything about the homework 50% weight to assignment, 50% weight to ZOOM interrogation    Special Relativity Spacetime Diagrams  Simplest visualization is 2D plot. One axis is ct, the other is x (ct is for consistent dimensions, could also do x/c to measure in units of time). The true diagram plots the vector $$ in a 4-dimensional manifold. Each one of these vectors is an event in spacetime  Worldline  Worldline denotes our trajectory through spacetime If you are stationary at x=0, then you get a vertical line at x = 0 If you walk to the right, then your x coordinate increases A light beam moves along the $45 \\degree$ lines (either in 1st or 2nd quadrant) The faster you go, the closer you slope gets to unity (ie. light speed) The future light cone denotes the area above the x axis between the light worldlines The past light cone denotes the area below the x axis between the light worldlines  Inertial Frames  Consider two frames, one stationary, the other strapped to a rocket (the prime frame). Observer has their own clocks and rulers The events measured by the rocket are given by $$, and the events in the lab are given by $$. The distinction is purely for bookkeeping. Assume that the rocket moves with velocity v relative to lab frame  Draw the worldline of the rocket in the lab frame. This is the axis ct’ of the rocket frame  This makes sense. The rocket observer is always at $x^{'}=0$ if they are not moving in their frame. So it makes sense that the worldline is the $ct^{'}$ axis   To draw the x’ axis, take the angle between ct’ and ct axis. Transfer this axis to a positive angle from the x axis. This is the x’ axis    Postulates of SR  Light has a constant speed of c Light moves isotropically for all observers Imagine in the lab frame, you have a point source of light. Then $x = ct \\rightarrow (ct)^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ Similarly, in the rocket frame, you get $x^{'} = ct^{'} \\rightarrow (ct^{'})^{2} = x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}$ We can combine the above to get: $(ct^{'})^{2} - x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2} = (ct)^{2} - x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} = s^{2}$  $s$ is invariant between reference frames and holds true for any event, not just light. Called the interval and is used to define distance in spacetime can also be defined as $-s^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}$    Deriving Time Dilation from diagrams  Suppose $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$ displacements occur lab frame. This corresponds to a displacement of $\\tau$ in rocket frame  rocket: $(c\\tau,0)$, lab: $(ct,x)$ The $s^{2}$ must be the same in both frames:  $c^{2}t^{2}-x^{2} = c^{2}\\tau^{2}$. Rearrange as needed to get time dilation      Deriving Doppler Shift from Diagram  The rocket is travelling at a velocity v. The rocket shots a light beam back to the lab frame (a 45 degree ray aimed at ct axis that starts at the end of the rocket trajectory)  The rocket has displacements $c \\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x = \\beta c \\Delta t$. In the rocket frame, this displacement is $\\tau$. The round trip time measured by the lab is: $\\Delta t_{r} = c\\Delta t + \\Delta x = c\\Delta t + \\beta c \\Delta t \\rightarrow \\Delta t_{r} = \\Delta t (1+\\beta)$  You add $\\Delta x$ because this is the elasped time that the light takes to reach x=0 from the rocket Substitute $\\Delta t$ with $\\Tau$ using invariance of $s^{2}$ and simplify $\\Delta t_{r} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}}$   $\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{e}}$ and $\\Delta t_{r} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{r}}$, where $\\nu_{e}$ is the emmision frequency and $\\nu_{e}$ is the receiver frequency In terms of wavelength:  $\\lambda_{r} = \\lambda_{e}\\sqrt{\\frac{1\\pm \\beta}{1\\mp \\beta}}$ (plus and minus depends on relative velocity direction)      Metrics Metric tensor (SR)  $ds^{2} = c^{2}dt^{2}-(dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2})$ metric denoted as $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ or $g_{\\mu \\nu}$  A diagonal matrix whose 0,0 component is 1 and other elements is -1 (convention dependent)    Covariant versus contravariant vectors  $dx^{\\mu} = (cdt,dx,dy,dz)$ contravariant (upper index) covariant (lower index) Can transform contravariant to covariant:  $dx_{\\mu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}dx^{\\mu}$ Uses Einstein summation convention: upper and lower indexes of the same variable are implicitly summed along that index   $ds^{2} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}dx^{\\mu}dx^{\\nu}$  This is a scalar (same in all reference frames) Definition of distance of a 4D spacetime vector   Contravariant: $X^{\\mu} = (ct, \\vec{x})$ Covariant: $X^{\\mu} = (ct, -\\vec{x})$ $X_{\\mu}X^{\\mu} = c^{2}t^{2}-|\\vec{x}|^{2}$  Metric in Spherical Coordinates  $ds^{2} = c^{2}dt^{2}-(dr^{2}+r^{2}[d\\theta^{2}+sin^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2}])$ $dx^{\\mu} = (cdt,dr,d\\theta,d\\phi)$  4-Momentum  $P^{\\mu} = (\\frac{E}{c},\\vec{p})$  $E = \\gamma mc^{2}$ $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m\\vec{v}$   $P^{\\mu}p_{\\mu} = (\\frac{E}{c})^{2}-|\\vec{p}|^{2} = (mc)^{2}$  c =1 because it is quite tedious to haul around. Can add in later m = 0 for a photon: $E = p$ For a particle of mass m at rest: $E=m$    Example  1 pc = 3.26 ly  $1\\ ly\\approx 10^{18}$   Uniformly spread throughout the universe is DM $DM+DM\\rightarrow \\bar{p}+\\bar{D}$  $DM$ refers to a dark matter particle $\\bar{p}$ is an antiproton $\\bar{D}$ is an antideuteron (deuteron = heavy hydrogen ie. 1 proton and 1 neutron)   Cosmic Ray ISM: $p+p\\rightarrow p+p+\\bar{p}+p$ $p+p\\rightarrow p+p+\\bar{p}+p+\\bar{n}+n$  Rarely $\\bar{p}+\\bar{n} \\rightarrow \\bar{D}$   How much energy does the cosmic ray need to make a $\\bar{p}p$ pair? Consider two frames (the lab frame and the center of mass frame):  The lab frame: The photons collide and scatter off  Let only 1 photon be moving and the other be at rest in the lab frame $P^{\\mu}_{lab,i1} = (E,P)$ $P^{\\mu}_{lab,i2} = (m,0)$ $P^{\\mu}_{T} = (E+m,P)$   The CM frame: At threshold energy, the protons collide and are not moving  $P^{\\mu}_{CM,f} = (4m,0)$   Conservation of momentum states $P^{\\mu}P_{\\mu}$ is the same before and after the collision in both frames The final momentum is the same in both the lab and the CM frame Comparing invariants: $E^{2}+2Em+m^{2}-P^{2} = 16m^{2}$  Rearrange and recalling that $E^{2}-P^{2}=m^{2}$, you get  E = 7m Recall $E = K+m \\rightarrow K = 6mc^{2}\\approx 6\\ GeV$       $F(E) \\propto E^{-2.7}$  units of $\\frac{particles}{m^{2}\\cdot sr \\cdot s \\cdot GeV}$ The antiduteron requires a significantly larger amount of energy to be produced from cosmic rays (HW problem) Because of the cosmic background spectrum, natural background of antideuterons from cosmic ray at low energy is pretty small Hence, low energy antideuterons are a “smoking gun* for dark matter because of this low background (below $K\\leq 200 MeV$ is about the energy predicted)    Classical Cosmology The Cosmological Principle  Our position in space and time is not special Local physics does not differ markedly from those made by other observers elsewhere in the universe  homogenous: all observers see the same thing isotropic: each observer sees the same thing regardless of direction   If you zoom out enough ($\\geq$ 100 Mpc), then the universe looks isotropic  Comoving Coordinates  A Comoving Observer who carries their clock with them (reading proper time) AND also carries their coordinate location with themselves an “event” is characterized by a comoving observer AND their time  Draw a coordinate system on the surface of an inflated balloon. Let each intersection be a comoving observer (ie. each observer denotes a position on the sphere). All the clocks are synchronized to time $t_{1}$ At a later time, after the balloon has expanded, we see that the distance between each observer has increased; however, each observer maintains their coordinate (ie. coordinate distance is NOT the same as physical distance)  Define a particular observer as (0,0) Define a scale factor $a(t)$ to denote the rate of expansion of the balloon Let $d_{1} = a(t_{1})\\vec{s}$, where $d_{1}$ is the physical distance at time $t_{1}$ and $\\vec{s}$ is the coordinate distance Let $d_{2} = a(t_{2})\\vec{s}$ at time $t_{2}$ Define $\\vec{v} = lim_{t_{2}\\rightarrow t_{1}}\\frac{d_{2}-d_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\\frac{a_{2}-a_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}\\vec{s} = \\dot{a}(t_{1})\\vec{s} = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}a\\vec{s}$    Hubble’s Law  The above yields Hubble’s Law: $\\vec{v} = H\\vec{d}$ with $H = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}$ Hubble Flow: the velocity of comoving observers due to the expansion of the universe Hubble’s Law implies homogeneity  Imagine two galaxies at positions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Hubble’s law states:  $\\vec{v_{1}} = H\\vec{x_{1}}$ $\\vec{v_{2}} = H\\vec{x_{2}}$   Subtract the two from each other demonstrates homogeneity, since the velocity between galaxies is independent of where you are in space    Non-Euclidean Geometry Particle Physics Theory Dark Matter Early Universe Physics Classical and Quantum Theory of the Scalar Field Inflationary cosmology revisited, and structure formation The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Primordial Black Holes and Hawking Radiation ",

<ul>
<li>Consider two frames, one stationary, the other strapped to a rocket (the prime frame). Observer has their own clocks and rulers</li>
<li>The events measured by the rocket are given by $&lt;ct^{'},x^{'},y^{'},z^{'}&gt;$, and the events in the lab are given by $&lt;ct,x,y,z&gt;$. The distinction is purely for bookkeeping.</li>
<li>Assume that the rocket moves with velocity v relative to lab frame
<ul>
<li>Draw the worldline of the rocket in the lab frame. This is the axis ct&rsquo; of the rocket frame
<ul>
<li>This makes sense. The rocket observer is always at $x^{'}=0$ if they are not moving in their frame. So it makes sense that the worldline is the $ct^{'}$ axis</li>
</ul>

<li>To draw the x&rsquo; axis, take the angle between ct&rsquo; and ct axis. Transfer this axis to a positive angle from the x axis. This is the x&rsquo; axis</li>

<li>Light has a constant speed of c</li>

<li>Imagine in the lab frame, you have a point source of light. Then $x = ct \rightarrow (ct)^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$</li>
<li>Similarly, in the rocket frame, you get $x^{'} = ct^{'} \rightarrow (ct^{'})^{2} = x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}$</li>
<li>We can combine the above to get:</li>
<li>$(ct^{'})^{2} - x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2} = (ct)^{2} - x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} = s^{2}$
<ul>
<li>$s$ is invariant between reference frames and holds true for any event, not just light. Called the interval and is used to define distance in spacetime</li>

<ul>
<li>The rocket is travelling at a velocity v. The rocket shots a light beam back to the lab frame (a 45 degree ray aimed at ct axis that starts at the end of the rocket trajectory)
<ul>
<li>The rocket has displacements $c \Delta t$ and $\Delta x =  \beta c \Delta t$. In the rocket frame, this displacement is $\tau$.</li>
<li>The round trip time measured by the lab is:</li>
<li>$\Delta t_{r} = c\Delta t + \Delta x = c\Delta t + \beta c \Delta t \rightarrow \Delta t_{r}  = \Delta t (1+\beta)$
<ul>
<li>You add $\Delta x$ because this is the elasped time that the light takes to reach x=0 from the rocket</li>
<li>Substitute $\Delta t$ with $\Tau$ using invariance of $s^{2}$ and simplify</li>
<li>$\Delta t_{r} = \sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}$</li>

<li>units of $\frac{particles}{m^{2}\cdot sr \cdot s \cdot GeV}$</li>
<li>The antiduteron requires a significantly larger amount of energy to be produced from cosmic rays (HW problem)</li>
