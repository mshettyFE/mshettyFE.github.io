Make sure weakest link knows everything about the homework 50% weight to assignment, 50% weight to ZOOM interrogation    Special Relativity Spacetime Diagrams  Simplest visualization is 2D plot. One axis is ct, the other is x (ct is for consistent dimensions, could also do x/c to measure in units of time). The true diagram plots the vector $$ in a 4-dimensional manifold. Each one of these vectors is an event in spacetime  Worldline  Worldline denotes our trajectory through spacetime If you are stationary at x=0, then you get a vertical line at x = 0 If you walk to the right, then your x coordinate increases A light beam moves along the $45 \\degree$ lines (either in 1st or 2nd quadrant) The faster you go, the closer you slope gets to unity (ie. light speed) The future light cone denotes the area above the x axis between the light worldlines The past light cone denotes the area below the x axis between the light worldlines  Inertial Frames  Consider two frames, one stationary, the other strapped to a rocket (the prime frame). Observer has their own clocks and rulers The events measured by the rocket are given by $$, and the events in the lab are given by $$. The distinction is purely for bookkeeping. Assume that the rocket moves with velocity v relative to lab frame  Draw the worldline of the rocket in the lab frame. This is the axis ct’ of the rocket frame  This makes sense. The rocket observer is always at $x^{'}=0$ if they are not moving in their frame. So it makes sense that the worldline is the $ct^{'}$ axis   To draw the x’ axis, take the angle between ct’ and ct axis. Transfer this axis to a positive angle from the x axis. This is the x’ axis    Postulates of SR  Light has a constant speed of c Light moves isotropically for all observers Imagine in the lab frame, you have a point source of light. Then $x = ct \\rightarrow (ct)^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$ Similarly, in the rocket frame, you get $x^{'} = ct^{'} \\rightarrow (ct^{'})^{2} = x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}$ We can combine the above to get: $(ct^{'})^{2} - x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2} = (ct)^{2} - x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} = s^{2}$  $s$ is invariant between reference frames and holds true for any event, not just light. Called the interval and is used to define distance in spacetime can also be defined as $-s^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}$    Deriving Time Dilation from diagrams  Suppose $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$ displacements occur lab frame. This corresponds to a displacement of $\\tau$ in rocket frame  rocket: $(c\\tau,0)$, lab: $(ct,x)$ The $s^{2}$ must be the same in both frames:  $c^{2}t^{2}-x^{2} = c^{2}\\tau^{2}$. Rearrange as needed to get time dilation      Deriving Doppler Shift from Diagram  The rocket is travelling at a velocity v. The rocket shots a light beam back to the lab frame (a 45 degree ray aimed at ct axis that starts at the end of the rocket trajectory)  The rocket has displacements $c \\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x = \\beta c \\Delta t$. In the rocket frame, this displacement is $\\tau$. The round trip time measured by the lab is: $\\Delta t_{r} = c\\Delta t + \\Delta x = c\\Delta t + \\beta c \\Delta t \\rightarrow \\Delta t_{r} = \\Delta t (1+\\beta)$  You add $\\Delta x$ because this is the elasped time that the light takes to reach x=0 from the rocket Substitute $\\Delta t$ with $\\Tau$ using invariance of $s^{2}$ and simplify $\\Delta t_{r} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}}$   $\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{e}}$ and $\\Delta t_{r} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{r}}$, where $\\nu_{e}$ is the emmision frequency and $\\nu_{e}$ is the receiver frequency In terms of wavelength:  $\\lambda_{r} = \\lambda_{e}\\sqrt{\\frac{1\\pm \\beta}{1\\mp \\beta}}$ (plus and minus depends on relative velocity direction)      Metrics Metric tensor (SR)  $ds^{2} = c^{2}dt^{2}-(dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2})$ metric denoted as $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ or $g_{\\mu \\nu}$  A diagonal matrix whose 0,0 component is 1 and other elements is -1 (convention dependent)    Covariant versus contravariant vectors  $dx^{\\mu} = (cdt,dx,dy,dz)$ contravariant (upper index) covariant (lower index) Can transform contravariant to covariant:  $dx_{\\mu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}dx^{\\mu}$ Uses Einstein summation convention: upper and lower indexes of the same variable are implicitly summed along that index   $ds^{2} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}dx^{\\mu}dx^{\\nu}$  This is a scalar (same in all reference frames) Definition of distance of a 4D spacetime vector   Contravariant: $X^{\\mu} = (ct, \\vec{x})$ Covariant: $X^{\\mu} = (ct, -\\vec{x})$ $X_{\\mu}X^{\\mu} = c^{2}t^{2}-|\\vec{x}|^{2}$  Metric in Spherical Coordinates  $ds^{2} = c^{2}dt^{2}-(dr^{2}+r^{2}[d\\theta^{2}+sin^{2}\\theta d\\phi^{2}])$ $dx^{\\mu} = (cdt,dr,d\\theta,d\\phi)$  4-Momentum  $P^{\\mu} = (\\frac{E}{c},\\vec{p})$  $E = \\gamma mc^{2}$ $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m\\vec{v}$   $P^{\\mu}p_{\\mu} = (\\frac{E}{c})^{2}-|\\vec{p}|^{2} = (mc)^{2}$  c =1 because it is quite tedious to haul around. Can add in later m = 0 for a photon: $E = p$ For a particle of mass m at rest: $E=m$    Example  1 pc = 3.26 ly  $1\\ ly\\approx 10^{18}$   Uniformly spread throughout the universe is DM $DM+DM\\rightarrow \\bar{p}+\\bar{D}$  $DM$ refers to a dark matter particle $\\bar{p}$ is an antiproton $\\bar{D}$ is an antideuteron (deuteron = heavy hydrogen ie. 1 proton and 1 neutron)   Cosmic Ray ISM: $p+p\\rightarrow p+p+\\bar{p}+p$ $p+p\\rightarrow p+p+\\bar{p}+p+\\bar{n}+n$  Rarely $\\bar{p}+\\bar{n} \\rightarrow \\bar{D}$   How much energy does the cosmic ray need to make a $\\bar{p}p$ pair? Consider two frames (the lab frame and the center of mass frame):  The lab frame: The photons collide and scatter off  Let only 1 photon be moving and the other be at rest in the lab frame $P^{\\mu}_{lab,i1} = (E,P)$ $P^{\\mu}_{lab,i2} = (m,0)$ $P^{\\mu}_{T} = (E+m,P)$   The CM frame: At threshold energy, the protons collide and are not moving  $P^{\\mu}_{CM,f} = (4m,0)$   Conservation of momentum states $P^{\\mu}P_{\\mu}$ is the same before and after the collision in both frames The final momentum is the same in both the lab and the CM frame Comparing invariants: $E^{2}+2Em+m^{2}-P^{2} = 16m^{2}$  Rearrange and recalling that $E^{2}-P^{2}=m^{2}$, you get  E = 7m Recall $E = K+m \\rightarrow K = 6mc^{2}\\approx 6\\ GeV$       $F(E) \\propto E^{-2.7}$  units of $\\frac{particles}{m^{2}\\cdot sr \\cdot s \\cdot GeV}$ The antiduteron requires a significantly larger amount of energy to be produced from cosmic rays (HW problem) Because of the cosmic background spectrum, natural background of antideuterons from cosmic ray at low energy is pretty small Hence, low energy antideuterons are a “smoking gun* for dark matter because of this low background (below $K\\leq 200 MeV$ is about the energy predicted)    Classical Cosmology The Cosmological Principle  Our position in space and time is not special Local physics does not differ markedly from those made by other observers elsewhere in the universe  homogenous: all observers see the same thing isotropic: each observer sees the same thing regardless of direction   If you zoom out enough ($\\geq$ 100 Mpc), then the universe looks isotropic  Comoving Coordinates  A Comoving Observer who carries their clock with them (reading proper time) AND also carries their coordinate location with themselves an “event” is characterized by a comoving observer AND their time  Draw a coordinate system on the surface of an inflated balloon. Let each intersection be a comoving observer (ie. each observer denotes a position on the sphere). All the clocks are synchronized to time $t_{1}$ At a later time, after the balloon has expanded, we see that the distance between each observer has increased; however, each observer maintains their coordinate (ie. coordinate distance is NOT the same as physical distance)  Define a particular observer as (0,0) Define a scale factor $a(t)$ to denote the rate of expansion of the balloon Let $d_{1} = a(t_{1})\\vec{s}$, where $d_{1}$ is the physical distance at time $t_{1}$ and $\\vec{s}$ is the coordinate distance Let $d_{2} = a(t_{2})\\vec{s}$ at time $t_{2}$ Define $\\vec{v} = lim_{t_{2}\\rightarrow t_{1}}\\frac{d_{2}-d_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\\frac{a_{2}-a_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}\\vec{s} = \\dot{a}(t_{1})\\vec{s} = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}a\\vec{s}$    Hubble’s Law  The above yields Hubble’s Law: $\\vec{v} = H\\vec{d}$ with $H = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}$ Hubble Flow: the velocity of comoving observers due to the expansion of the universe Hubble’s Law implies homogeneity  Imagine two galaxies at positions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$. Hubble’s law states:  $\\vec{v_{1}} = H\\vec{x_{1}}$ $\\vec{v_{2}} = H\\vec{x_{2}}$   Subtract the two from each other demonstrates homogeneity the velocity between galaxies is independent of where you are in space (ie. it only depends on the relative distance between galaxies) $H_{0}=\\frac{\\dot{a}(t_{0})}{a(t_{0})}$ is the Hubble constant measured “locally” and measured between galaxies that are “not to distant”    Wavelength relation to scale factor  Consider 2 galaxies on different comoving coordinates  The wavelength at one galaxy is $\\lambda(t)$ The wavelength of the first galaxy as measured by the second galaxy is  $\\lambda(t+\\delta t)=\\lambda(t)(1+\\frac{v}{c})$ $\\delta t = \\frac{l}{c}$ where $l$ is the distance between the galaxies $v=Hl=\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\delta t$  Plug this into the wavelength as observed by the second galaxy, rearrange and divide by $\\delta t$ to eventually get $\\frac{\\dot{\\lambda}}{\\lambda}=\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\rightarrow \\lambda \\propto a$     An important quantity is $\\frac{\\lambda(t_{o})}{\\lambda(t_{e})}=\\frac{\\dot{a}(t_{o})}{a(t_{e})}=1+Z$  $Z=\\frac{\\lambda(t_{0})-\\lambda(t_{e})}{\\lambda(t_{e})}=\\frac{v}{c}$. THis is called the redshift. You can have $Z\\geq 1$ since $v\\leq c$ only in inertial frames of reference (ie. the universe expands faster than c)      Luminosity Distance (L)  Luminosity: $L=\\frac{erg}{s}$ Flux $F=\\frac{erg}{s*cm^{2}}=\\frac{L}{4\\pi D_{L}^{2}}$ The luminosity distance is defined as $D_{L}=\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{4\\pi F}}$ $D_{L} = D_{L}(Z,args)$ where $args$ are relevant cosmological parameters.  Non-Euclidean Geometry  Flat space denotes a metric whose entries are constant  Or in GR terms, the vanishing of the Riemann curvature tensor    Metric of a 2-Sphere  Embbed a sphere of radius $R$ in $\\mathbb{R^{3}}$  $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}= R^{2}$ (definition of sphere/ constraint equation) $dl^{2} = dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^{2}$ (definition of distance in $\\R^{3}$) replace $dx_{3}^{2}$ by taking the total derivative of the constraint equation and eliminating $x_{3}$. You eventually get  $dl^{2}=dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{1}^{2}+\\frac{x_{1}dx_{1}+x_{2}dx_{2}}{R^{2}-x^{2}_{1}-x^{2}_{2}}$   Convert to polar coordinates ($x_{1} = R\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)$ and $x_{2} = R\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)$) and simplifying:  $dl^{2}=R^{2}(d\\theta^{2}+\\sin^{2}(\\theta) d\\phi^{2})$ This is the metric of the 2 sphere     Is the 2-sphere Euclidean?  In Euclidean space, the ratio of the circumference to the radius is $2\\pi$   What is the radius of a circle on a 2-sphere?  Align the z-axis with the center of the circle. The circle is then at a fixed $\\theta$ where $\\phi$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$ Therefore, the circumference equals $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} R\\sin(\\theta)d\\phi = 2\\pi R \\sin(\\theta)$ The radius is $a=\\int_{0}^{\\theta}Rd\\theta=R\\theta$ hence the ratio of the circumference to the radius is less than $2\\pi$    Metric of the 3-sphere  Embed a 3-sphere in $\\R^{4}$  $r^{2}+x_{4}^{2}= R^{2}$ (definition of sphere/ constraint equation)  $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}= r^{2}$   $dl^{2} = dx_{1}^{2}+dx_{2}^{2}+dx_{3}^{2}+dx_{4}^{2}$ (definition of distance in $\\R^{3}$) Do the same process as the 2-sphere to eliminate $dx_{4}$ from the distance measure (differentiate constraint, eliminate $x_{4}$ in constraint, plug into metric, write in spherical coordinates)  $x_{1} = r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi$ $x_{2} = r\\sin(\\theta)\\cos\\phi$ $x_{3} = r\\cos(\\theta)$   You eventually get the following metric:  $dl^{2}=\\frac{R^{2}dr^{2}}{R^{2}-r^{2}}+r^{2}d\\theta^{2}+r^{2}\\sin\\theta d\\phi^{2}$ Alternatively: $dl^{2}=\\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}}}+r^{2}d\\Omega^{2}$      Metric of the Pseudosphere (hyperbolic geometry)  The constraint becomes:  $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2} = -R^{2}$ $dl^{2}=\\frac{R^{2}dr^{2}}{R^{2}+r^{2}}+r^{2}d\\theta^{2}+r^{2}\\sin\\theta d\\phi^{2}$ As $R\\rightarrow\\infty$ you recover flat space   You can also make the following subtitutions:  $K=1\\rightarrow r=R\\sin\\chi$ $K=-1\\rightarrow r=R\\sinh\\chi$ $K=0\\rightarrow r=\\chi R$   These transformations convert the metric to:  $dl^{2}=R^{2}[d\\chi^{2}+\\sigma^{2}(\\chi)d\\Omega^{2}]$  $\\sigma(\\chi) = \\sin\\chi$ $\\sigma(\\chi) = \\sinh\\chi$ $\\sigma(\\chi) = \\chi$   You can interpret $\\chi$ as a distance parameter (ie. a surogate to r)   Alternatively:  $dl^{2} = \\frac{dr^{2}}{1-Kr^{2}}+r^{2}(d\\theta^{2}+\\sin^{2}(\\theta)d\\phi^{2})$  $K = \\frac{1}{R^{2}}$,$\\frac{-1}{R^{2}}$,$0$ for spherical, hyperbolic and flat geometries respectively     To calculate radii and circumference on the 3-sphere, set $\\theta = \\frac{pi}{2}$ for simplicity. This also implies that $d\\theta=0$  Circumfrence $C = \\int_{\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}} dl = 2\\pi R \\sin(\\chi)$ where theta and radius $\\sin(\\chi)$ are fixed Radius $R = \\int_{0}^{\\chi}Rd\\chi=R\\chi$ Note that $\\frac{C}{R}$ is not $\\pi$   What is the volume element?  Take the square root of the of the determinant of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ (for the 3-sphere, $g_{ij}$ is a diagonal matrix. Don’t forget to include the time component to use this rule!)  Ex. for the 3-sphere $V = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} d\\chi \\int_{0}^{\\pi} d\\theta \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\phi R^{3}\\sin^{2}(\\chi)\\sin(\\theta) = 2\\pi R^{3}$     For the surface element, you ignore the radial term (ie. set $d\\Omega = 0$)  Most general homogeneous isotropic metric  $ds^{2} = c^{2}dt^{2}-R^{2}a^{2}[d\\chi^{2}+\\sigma^{2}(\\chi) d\\Theta^{2}]$ $a(t_{0}) = 1$ is the scale factor at the present time Say we want to find the distance between two comoving observers.  We need to measure the distance at a fixed time ($dt=0$). We also fix $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ to get  $ds = Ra(t)d\\chi \\rightarrow \\frac{ds}{dt} = R d\\chi \\dot{a} \\rightarrow V = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}(aRd\\chi) = Hd$ Because Hubble’s law falls out of this metric (the R-W metric), this shows that this metric is homogeneous      What is $a(t)?$  Imagine a disk with a hole in the center. The hole has radius $a(t)R$ There exists $\\rho_{\\mu}(r)$ in this volume (which represents a volume element of the universe) Make the hole small enough so that you can remove the mass inside the hole  Assume Birkhoff’s Theorem: An empty cavity surrounded by a spherically symmetric mass distribution has the Minkowski spacetime geometry (a fancy way of saying that since there is no gravitational field inside the cavity, you can use SR inside the hole)   Place a small mass $m$ on the boundary between the hole and the volume, and Place mass $M$ at the center of the hole The density inside the hole is $\\rho_{in} = \\frac{M}{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}(aR)^{3}}$ Using conservation of energy:  $\\frac{m(R\\dot{a})^{2}}{2}-\\frac{GMm}{aR}=K$  Multiply by $\\frac{a^{2}}{R^{2}}$ and redefine the mess on the RHS as K to get $(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^{2} -\\frac{8\\pi G\\rho}{3} = \\frac{-Kc^{2}}{a^{2}R^{2}}$ (Friedmann 1)  interpret K as the Gaussian curvature ($K=0,\\pm1 $). Also interpret $\\rho$ as the mass energy density  $\\rho = \\rho_{m}+\\rho_{r}+\\rho_{\\Lambda}$, where $\\rho_{m}$ is the mass density,$\\rho_{m}$ is the radiation density,$\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is the dark energy density     Define $\\rho_{c} = \\frac{3H^{2}}{8\\pi G}$ as the critical density Define $\\Omega = \\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{c}}$ You can rewrite the time-evolution of $a(t)$ as :  $1-\\Omega = \\frac{-K}{a^{2}R^{2}H^{2}}$       What all this means is that since you can measure $\\Omega$ today (this sets $a(t_{0})=1$), you can tell what the geometry of the universe is (by measuring the sign of K)  This also motivates why $p_{c}$ is called the critical density. It tells you the boundary between different large-scale geometries    Adiabatic expansion  Assume adiabatic expansion $dE+PdV = dQ = 0$ Assume that you start with a universe of total mass M. * As the universe expands, the universe loses some mass (ie. uses some energy) in order to expand (ie. $\\dot{M} $\\frac{m\\dot{a}^{2}}{2}-\\frac{GMm}{a}= K{'}$ Take the derivative w.r.t. time (don’t forget that mass changes over time) $\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\dot{E} = \\dot{M}c^{2} = -P\\frac{dV}{dt} = -P\\dot{V}$ from the the adiabatic assumption We know (setting R=1) that $\\dot{V} = 4\\pi a^{2}\\dot{a}\\rightarrow \\dot{M} = 4\\pi a^{2}\\dot{a}P$ After some algebra, we get $\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = \\frac{-4\\pi G}{c}(\\rho+3P)$ (Friedmann 2)  We view the $3P$ term as an effective mass term   $\\frac{d(\\rho V)}{dt} = P\\frac{-dV}{dt}$  Take time derivatives and substitute in volume (and derivative of volume) of the 2-sphere (use 2-sphere instead of 3-sphere because dealing with local patch of spacetime) to reach $\\dot{p} = -(\\rho+P)3H$    Friedmann Equations Summary  F1: $(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^{2} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho(a) - \\frac{K}{a^{2}R^{2}} =\\rightarrow H^{2}(1-\\Omega_{t}) = \\frac{-K}{a^{2}R^{2}}$  $\\Omega_{T} = \\frac{\\rho_{m}+\\rho_{r}+\\rho_{\\Lambda}}{\\rho_{c}}$   F2: $\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{d} = \\frac{-4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho+3P)$ F3: $\\dot{-3H(\\rho+P)}$  Pure Matter Energy Density  The order of magnitude of the CMB is about 1E-4 eV. The mass of a proton is about 1E9 eV. This means we can, for simplicity, ignore the pressure term for now Using F3, make the zero pressure assumption, substitute in the definition of $H = \\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}$, turn the differential equation crank yields that  $\\rho_{m}$ ~ $a^{-3}$ Alternatively, $\\rho_{m} = (1+Z)^{3}\\rho_{m0}$    Pure Radiation Energy Density  From Thermodynamics, we know that for photons : $P_{r} = \\frac{1}{3}\\rho_{r}$ Plug into F3, turn the crank yields $\\rho_{r}$ ~ $a^{-4}$  As you expand a volume element of photons, the number of photons is fixed, but the volume drops by $a^{-3}$. The extra a term comes from redshifting    Dark Energy  $\\dot{\\rho} = \\frac{-3\\dot{a}}{a}(\\rho_{\\Lambda}+P_{\\Lambda})$  A very standard model of dark energy posits that $P_{\\Lambda} = -\\rho_{\\Lambda} \\rightarrow \\rho_{\\Lambda} = constant\\rightarrow \\dot{\\rho_{\\Lambda}} = 0$    q  Define $q_{o} = \\frac{-\\ddot{a}a}{\\dot{a}^{2}}$ Using F2 (we can ignore radiation density and make the pressureless assumption on mass pressure)  $\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = \\frac{-4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho_{m}-2\\rho_{\\Lambda})$  This means that the matter causes the universe expansion to slow down over time, while the dark energy accelerates the expansion      Age of the Universe  $H_{0}^{2} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho_{co}(\\frac{\\rho_{m}}{\\rho_{co}}+\\frac{\\rho_{r}}{\\rho_{co}}+\\frac{\\rho_{\\Lambda}}{\\rho_{co}}+\\frac{\\rho_{k}}{\\rho_{co}})$  We cheat a little and pretend that the curvature is actually an energy density We can substitute all the $\\rho$ with the approriate redshift formula to yield   $H^{2}(z) = H_{0}^{2}[\\Omega_{mo}(1+Z)^{3}+\\Omega_{ro}(1+Z)^{4}+\\Omega_{ko}(1+Z)^{2}+\\Omega_{\\Lambda}]$  $\\Omega_{m0}+\\Omega_{r0}+\\Omega_{k0}+\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 1$   $a(Z) = \\frac{a_{0}}{(1+Z)}$ $\\dot{a}(Z) = \\frac{a_{0}\\dot{Z}}{(1+Z)^{2}}$ Plugging into the definition of H and mixing terms yields  $\\frac{dt}{dz} = \\frac{-1}{H(Z)(1+Z)}$    Einstein-de Sitter Universe  Let $\\Omega_{m0} = 1 = \\frac{\\rho_{m0}}{\\rho_{c0}}$, and $\\Omega_{r} = \\Omega_{\\Lambda} =0$ To figure out the geometry of the universe:  $1-\\Omega_{0} = \\frac{-K}{a_{0}^{2}R^{2}H_{0}^{2}}$   We assume a pressureless universe, so from F1  $(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^{2} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3} \\rho_{m} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho_{co}(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^{3} = H_{0}^{2}(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^{3}$ where the second equality comes from F3 Taking the square root and integrating a from 0 to $a(t)$ and time from 0 to t to yields  $\\frac{2}{3}a(t)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = H_{0}a_{o}^{\\frac{3}{2}}t \\rightarrow a(t) = (\\frac{3}{2}H_{0}t)^{\\frac{2}{3}}a_{0}$ This means that the age of the universe in this model is $T_{u} = \\frac{2}{3}H_{0}^{-1}$ (set $a_{0}=1$ and set the time to be the current age of the universe $T_{u}$)   Problem: $T_{u}$ is about 9 GYr since $H_{0}$ is 14 GYr. There are some objects that are older than this    Einstein Static Universe  We slap on the curvature energy density and a fudge factor $\\Lambda$ (the cosmological constant) to F1  $(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a})^{2} = \\frac{8\\pi G\\rho_{m}}{3}-\\frac{K}{a^{2}R^{2}}+\\frac{\\Lambda}{3}$ Specify that $\\dot{a} = 0$ for a static universe $\\Lambda = 8\\pi G \\rho_{\\Lambda}$   Using F2: $\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{d} = \\frac{-4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho_{m}+3P_{m}+\\rho_{\\Lambda}+3P_{\\Lambda})$  $P_{m}=0$ and $P_{\\Lambda} = -\\rho_{\\Lambda}$   Setting $\\dot{a}$ and $\\ddot{a}$ to zero and crunching the algebra yields that $\\frac{4\\pi G}{3}\\rho_{m} = \\frac{Kc^{2}}{a^{2}R^{2}}$. This means that $K =1$ and $\\Lambda = \\frac{3C^{2}}{a^{2}R^{2}}$ The problem with this model is is not stable to as time evolves  deSitter Universe  Let $\\rho_{r} = \\rho_{m} = 0$ and $\\rho_{\\Lambda} = -P_{\\Lambda}$ Using F2: $\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = \\frac{-4\\pi G}{3}(\\rho_{\\Lambda}+3P_{\\Lambda})$ Hence $\\ddot{a} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}a \\rho_{\\Lambda} \\rightarrow a(t) = a(0)exp(t\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi G}{c}\\rho_{\\Lambda}})$  Dark Energy versus Cosmological Constant  Let $\\rho_{\\Lambda} = \\frac{\\Lambda}{8\\pi G}$ where the LHS is Dark energy and the RHS is a cosmological constant The distinction in that in the Einstein field equations, you can either add the cosmological constant to the curvature part (which is the cosmological constant), or add a vacuum energy to the energy part (dark energy)  Particle Physics Theory Dark Matter Early Universe Physics Classical and Quantum Theory of the Scalar Field Inflationary cosmology revisited, and structure formation The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Primordial Black Holes and Hawking Radiation ",

<ul>
<li>Consider two frames, one stationary, the other strapped to a rocket (the prime frame). Observer has their own clocks and rulers</li>
<li>The events measured by the rocket are given by $&lt;ct^{'},x^{'},y^{'},z^{'}&gt;$, and the events in the lab are given by $&lt;ct,x,y,z&gt;$. The distinction is purely for bookkeeping.</li>
<li>Assume that the rocket moves with velocity v relative to lab frame
<ul>
<li>Draw the worldline of the rocket in the lab frame. This is the axis ct&rsquo; of the rocket frame
<ul>
<li>This makes sense. The rocket observer is always at $x^{'}=0$ if they are not moving in their frame. So it makes sense that the worldline is the $ct^{'}$ axis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To draw the x&rsquo; axis, take the angle between ct&rsquo; and ct axis. Transfer this axis to a positive angle from the x axis. This is the x&rsquo; axis</li>

<li>Imagine in the lab frame, you have a point source of light. Then $x = ct \rightarrow (ct)^{2} = x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}$</li>
<li>Similarly, in the rocket frame, you get $x^{'} = ct^{'} \rightarrow (ct^{'})^{2} = x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}$</li>
<li>We can combine the above to get:</li>

<ul>
<li>The rocket is travelling at a velocity v. The rocket shots a light beam back to the lab frame (a 45 degree ray aimed at ct axis that starts at the end of the rocket trajectory)
<ul>
<li>The rocket has displacements $c \Delta t$ and $\Delta x =  \beta c \Delta t$. In the rocket frame, this displacement is $\tau$.</li>
<li>The round trip time measured by the lab is:</li>
<li>$\Delta t_{r} = c\Delta t + \Delta x = c\Delta t + \beta c \Delta t \rightarrow \Delta t_{r}  = \Delta t (1+\beta)$
<ul>
<li>You add $\Delta x$ because this is the elasped time that the light takes to reach x=0 from the rocket</li>
<li>Substitute $\Delta t$ with $\Tau$ using invariance of $s^{2}$ and simplify</li>
<li>$\Delta t_{r} = \sqrt{\frac{1-\beta}{1+\beta}}$</li>

<li>$\tau \propto \frac{1}{\nu_{e}}$  and $\Delta t_{r} \propto \frac{1}{\nu_{r}}$, where $\nu_{e}$ is the emmision frequency and $\nu_{e}$ is the receiver frequency</li>

<li>$H_{0}^{2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_{co}(\frac{\rho_{m}}{\rho_{co}}+\frac{\rho_{r}}{\rho_{co}}+\frac{\rho_{\Lambda}}{\rho_{co}}+\frac{\rho_{k}}{\rho_{co}})$
<ul>
<li>We cheat a little and pretend that the curvature is actually an energy density</li>
<li>We can substitute all the $\rho$ with the approriate redshift formula to yield</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$H^{2}(z) = H_{0}^{2}[\Omega_{mo}(1+Z)^{3}+\Omega_{ro}(1+Z)^{4}+\Omega_{ko}(1+Z)^{2}+\Omega_{\Lambda}]$
<ul>
<li>$\Omega_{m0}+\Omega_{r0}+\Omega_{k0}+\Omega_{\Lambda} = 1$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$a(Z) = \frac{a_{0}}{(1+Z)}$</li>
<li>$\dot{a}(Z) = \frac{a_{0}\dot{Z}}{(1+Z)^{2}}$</li>
<li>Plugging into the definition of H and mixing terms yields

<li>$\frac{dt}{dz} = \frac{-1}{H(Z)(1+Z)}$</li>

<h3 id="einstein-de-sitter-universe">Einstein-de Sitter Universe<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#einstein-de-sitter-universe">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Let $\Omega_{m0} = 1 = \frac{\rho_{m0}}{\rho_{c0}}$, and $\Omega_{r} = \Omega_{\Lambda} =0$</li>
<li>To figure out the geometry of the universe:
<ul>
<li>$1-\Omega_{0} = \frac{-K}{a_{0}^{2}R^{2}H_{0}^{2}}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We assume a pressureless universe, so from F1
<ul>
<li>$(\frac{\dot{a}}{a})^{2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_{m} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{co}(\frac{\dot{a}}{a})^{3} = H_{0}^{2}(\frac{\dot{a}}{a})^{3}$ where the second equality comes from F3</li>
<li>Taking the square root and integrating a from 0 to $a(t)$ and time from 0 to t to yields
<ul>
<li>$\frac{2}{3}a(t)^{\frac{3}{2}} = H_{0}a_{o}^{\frac{3}{2}}t \rightarrow a(t) = (\frac{3}{2}H_{0}t)^{\frac{2}{3}}a_{0}$</li>
<li>This means that the age of the universe in this model is $T_{u} = \frac{2}{3}H_{0}^{-1}$ (set $a_{0}=1$ and set the time to be the current age of the universe $T_{u}$)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem: $T_{u}$ is about 9 GYr since $H_{0}$ is 14 GYr. There are some objects that are older than this</li>

<h3 id="einstein-static-universe">Einstein Static Universe<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#einstein-static-universe">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We slap on the curvature energy density and a fudge factor $\Lambda$ (the cosmological constant) to F1
<ul>
<li>$(\frac{\dot{a}}{a})^{2} = \frac{8\pi G\rho_{m}}{3}-\frac{K}{a^{2}R^{2}}+\frac{\Lambda}{3}$</li>
<li>Specify that $\dot{a} = 0$ for a static universe</li>
<li>$\Lambda = 8\pi G \rho_{\Lambda}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using F2: $\frac{\ddot{a}}{d} = \frac{-4\pi G}{3}(\rho_{m}+3P_{m}+\rho_{\Lambda}+3P_{\Lambda})$
<ul>
<li>$P_{m}=0$ and $P_{\Lambda} = -\rho_{\Lambda}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Setting $\dot{a}$ and $\ddot{a}$ to zero and crunching the algebra yields that $\frac{4\pi G}{3}\rho_{m} = \frac{Kc^{2}}{a^{2}R^{2}}$. This means that $K =1$ and $\Lambda = \frac{3C^{2}}{a^{2}R^{2}}$</li>
<li>The problem with this model is is not stable to as time evolves</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="desitter-universe">deSitter Universe<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#desitter-universe">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Let $\rho_{r} = \rho_{m} = 0$ and $\rho_{\Lambda} = -P_{\Lambda}$</li>
<li>Using F2: $\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = \frac{-4\pi G}{3}(\rho_{\Lambda}+3P_{\Lambda})$</li>
<li>Hence $\ddot{a} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}a \rho_{\Lambda} \rightarrow a(t) = a(0)exp(t\sqrt{\frac{8\pi G}{c}\rho_{\Lambda}})$</li>

<h3 id="dark-energy-versus-cosmological-constant">Dark Energy versus Cosmological Constant<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dark-energy-versus-cosmological-constant">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Let $\rho_{\Lambda} = \frac{\Lambda}{8\pi G}$ where the LHS is Dark energy and the RHS is a cosmological constant</li>
<li>The distinction in that in the Einstein field equations, you can either add the cosmological constant to the curvature part (which is the cosmological constant), or add a vacuum energy to the energy part (dark energy)</li>
