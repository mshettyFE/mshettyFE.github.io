      <description>Here is a compendium of my notes that I took to review for Machine Learning. This was meant to be a quick refresher on concepts and to put everything in one place. For a less cursory version, see the background section under Resources at the course website.

      <title>2D Ising Model</title>

      <description>The Ising Model is a simple thermodynamic model of magnetic material that can visually demonstrate phase transitions. Attached is a client-side simulation of the Ising model that takes heavy inspiration from Daniel Schroeder. I modified his code to be asyncronous, allowed an arbitrary square lattice size, introduced more parameters that could be fiddled with, and added plots to visualize parameters of interest. I plan on adding more detail on the theory behind this model soon.</description>

      <title>How to Set Up a Webserver Pt. 1</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to create my own website, so during winter break, I decided to do just that. I could have gone about it the smart way by hosting on a cloud provider like AWS or the like.
I decide to do it the hard way and run my own webserver.
Do I regret it? A bit, since it cost more than I would like (although hopefully in the long term, I recoup that investment since the only persistent cost is the domain name and minor electricity usage).</description>
